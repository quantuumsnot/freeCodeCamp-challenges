  <h3><em>Most notable dates in history of electricity</em></h3>
          <ul class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;">
            <li><strong>2750 BC</strong> - Some egyptians started to step on an electric eels</li>
            <li><strong>1750 BC</strong> - 1000 years later nothing changed - Greek, Roman and Arabic step on an electric eels too</li>
            <li><strong>600 BC</strong> - Thales found static electricity, probably by handshaking with a fellow businessman during a period of a good olive harvest</li>
            <li><strong>1600 AD</strong> - William Gilbert distinguished the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. Seems we waited only ~2200 years for this to happen ...</li>
            <li><strong>~1745 AD</strong> - Dutch scientist Leyden and german clerik Kleist independently invented the capacitor</li>
            <li><strong>~1750 AD</strong> - Benjamin Franklin found the two types of electric charges, then proved the lightning is an electricity by using a kite and a house key</li>
            <li><strong>1791 AD</strong> - A guy named Luigi Galvani successfully managed to move the legs of a couple of dead frogs using electricity and stated that "electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles" , ... </li>
            <li><strong>1800 AD</strong> - ... but Alessandro Volta proved that Galvani is wrong, ie the medium was the metal wire used by Galvani in his experiments. Later Volta also created and one of the first electrochemical cells, or the battery. Great day for our bicycle flashlights, and not so great for Galvani, which probably hated Volta a lot</li>
            <li><strong>1800-1820 AD</strong> - Two French scientists, Ampère and Coulomb, and Danish Ørsted, experimented a lot in the field of electromagnetism, which was enough their names to be used in physics textbooks to this day</li>
            <li><strong>1821 AD</strong> - Michael Faraday invented the electric motor, so we can use them in radio-controlled models</li>
            <li><strong>1827 AD</strong> - Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit which established his famous law, but it's very annoying why we still cannot calculate properly the resistor values for our LED contraptions</li>
            <li><strong>1861-1862 AD</strong> - James Maxwell mathematically found the waveform nature of electric and magnetic fields, and concluded that the light is some form of electro-magnetic wave (whoa!), ... </li>
            <li><strong> 1879 AD</strong> - ... later Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's equations through experiments with radio waves (another whoa!). In his honor we use his name for unit of frequency (Hz - hertz). In <strong>1887 AD</strong> he found also that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily ...</li>
            <li><strong>1905 AD</strong> - which led Albert Einstein to publish his work on the photoelectric effect, so today we can use solar panels</li>
            </ul>
